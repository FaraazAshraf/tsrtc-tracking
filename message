Notice;I have found out that the URLs that I was using as APIs to access the servers have been modified. It will take me some days to change the URLs for the app in an upcoming update. Until then, only "search by stop", "search timings", "view airport pushpak timings", and "search stop location" function is working correctly. Sorry for the inconvenience.
